steps:1.pip install virtualenv
2.virtualenv env
## pip install virtualenv: 
This part of the command is used to install the virtualenv package. pip is the package installer for Python, and it is used to download and install Python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI). By running this command, you are instructing pip to download and install the virtualenv package on your system.

## virtualenv env: 
Once you have virtualenv installed, you can use it to create a virtual environment. A virtual environment is an isolated environment where you can install Python packages separately from the system-wide Python installation. This allows you to manage dependencies for different projects without interference.

The argument env in the command represents the name of the virtual environment you want to create. You can choose any name you like for your virtual environment, but "env" is a common convention used to indicate that it is an environment directory.

When you execute the full command virtualenv env, it will create a new directory named "env" (or whatever name you provided) in the current directory. Inside this directory, a new Python environment will be set up with its own Python interpreter and a separate set of installed packages.

To activate the virtual environment, you'll need to use the appropriate command based on your operating system:

# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux:
source env/bin/activate
After activation, your command prompt will change to show the name of the active virtual environment, indicating that you are now working within that environment. You can then use pip to install Python packages specific to this virtual environment without affecting the system-wide Python installation or other virtual environments.
